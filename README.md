# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
The Bitcoin Price Prediction project aims to forecast future Bitcoin prices using historical data and various machine learning techniques. This project leverages time-series analysis and machine learning algorithms to predict the price of Bitcoin based on past trends and patterns.
# Bitcoin Price Prediction

This project uses historical Bitcoin price data to predict future prices using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately predict Bitcoin prices based on historical data. The project uses various machine learning algorithms and techniques to achieve this goal.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes historical Bitcoin price data with features such as date, opening price, closing price, high, low, and volume.

## Model

The project explores different machine learning models, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks

## Results

The models are evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting Bitcoin prices. The best-performing model is chosen based on its performance on the test data.
